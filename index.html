            <p> I once used Goodreads, but it seems more live action role-playing and less reading, in addition to being a terrible user experience.
		Anyway, as the Haruki Murakami quote goes:</p><br><br>
		<blockquote><i>"If you only read the books that everyone else is reading, you can only think what everyone else is thinking."</i></blockquote>
		<br><br>
		
		<p>Also, I finish maybe one in every ten books, which turns Goodreads into a chore and takes all the fun out of reading. 
		Imagine the horror of seeing 43 books in the currently-reading section. <br><br>
		</p>

		<p>I don't like writing summaries/reviews, but plan to write them as much as possible. You can look at the books I read in a particular year
		and their summaries in the yearly links.<br>

		The main list is the books I have read, plan to read, or want to read in no particular order. The black/blue links are for read/not read 
		titles respectively.<br>
		I have color coded my recommendations in red, and must-reads in red and bold.<br><br>
		</p>
	      

		<p>I don't believe in 'formative' books. Nor do I think a book should strike two people with the same intensity. <br>
		That being said, some books are powerful enough to be formative. Always be skeptical, for books are excellent slaves but terrible masters. <br>

		Most importantly, reading is <b>NOT</b> a job. Don't try to make it one.<br>
		</p>
